      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       dig  is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs\n",
      "       DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned  from  the  name\n",
      "       server(s)  that  were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to trou‐\n",
      "       bleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clar‐\n",
      "       ity  of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than\n",
      "       dig.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also  has\n",
      "       a  batch  mode  of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A\n",
      "       brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when\n",
      "       the -h option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementa‐\n",
      "       tion of dig allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Unless it is told to query a specific name server, dig will try each of\n",
      "       the  servers  listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server addresses\n",
      "       are found, dig will send the query to the local host.\n",
      "\n",
      "       When no command line arguments or options are given, dig  will  perform\n",
      "       an NS query for \".\" (the root).\n",
      "\n",
      "       It  is  possible  to  set per-user defaults for dig via ${HOME}/.digrc.\n",
      "       This file is read and any options in it are applied before the  command\n",
      "       line  arguments.  The -r option disables this feature, for scripts that\n",
      "       need predictable behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top  level  domain\n",
      "       names.  Either use the -t and -c options to specify the type and class,\n",
      "       use the -q the specify the domain name, or use  \"IN.\"  and  \"CH.\"  when\n",
      "       looking up these top level domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "SIMPLE USAGE\n",
      "       A typical invocation of dig looks like:\n",
      "\n",
      "          dig @server name type\n",
      "\n",
      "       where:\n",

      "       server is  the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can\n",
      "              be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address\n",
      "              in  colon-delimited  notation. When the supplied server argument\n",
      "              is a hostname, dig resolves that name before querying that  name\n",
      "              server.\n",
      "\n",

      "              use, then only addresses for the corresponding transport will be\n",
      "              tried. If no usable addresses are found, dig will send the query\n",
      "              to the local host. The reply from the name server that  responds\n",
      "              is displayed.\n",
